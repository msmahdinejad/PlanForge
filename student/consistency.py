    Return True iff assigning `value` to `variable` does not violate any hard
    constraint with the current partial assignment.

    You should check at least:
      - the rectangle is inside the apartment boundary
      - the room area is inside its allowed range
      - it does not overlap already assigned rooms
      - all relevant unary/binary constraints that are currently checkable
